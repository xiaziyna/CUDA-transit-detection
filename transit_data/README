This is the test-set for GPU-accelerated transit detection. 

Scripts to generate inverse noise covariance matrices with TESS lightcurves.

Sample of 1000 TESS 2-min lightcurves, from year 3, over 28-day long sectors: 27, 28, 29. 
Injected with transit signals in the period range 0.5 - 20 days.

Place the folders in 'transit_data' folder

Run cov_inv for specific sector and lc_index,
Remember to mask the lightcurve 'detrend' to ignore 'bad_data'
